# Supply Chain Track and Trace System

## Objective
Design and implement a system that allows users to track and trace supply chain items.

## Components
The system will have two main components:
1. REST API
2. Web Application

## Minimum Requirements (Frontend)
The Web Application, (Single Page Application) at a minimum, must:
1. Offer end users the capability to query the supply chain trail of an item by using the query interface offered by the
REST API. 
2. It must be Javascript / TypeScript using your favourite SPA framework.


## Addtional Requirements (Frontend)
The following bonus requirements could also be met:
1. Responsive web application, as mobile users are also expected.
2. Dockerfile for deployment of the Web application.
